systemctl and systemctl status
	get a list of all processes and state
	see runtime error

all processes spawned by a service are placed in a cgroup
	processes and children cannot leave their cgroup

systemd-cgls
	list systemd cgroups in a pretty hierarchal tree

writing systemd units
	more portable than sysv init scripts
	[Unit]
		info about the unit - description, dependencies
		information specific to unit type (service, mount, socket, etc..)
	[Service]
		specifically for services
		what command to run, what kind of process (forking)
	[Install]
		what triggers this unit

	other types
	dbus - forking was for when init scripts were just Bourne scripts, needed to fork and break off from parent process to daemonize
		this is unecessary and slow
		Type=dbus - change type to dbus
		BusName=com.redhat.abrt - what it appears as on dbus
